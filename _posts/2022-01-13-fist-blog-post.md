Hi there. Tried to set up a github.io blog to learn a bit more about what GitHub can offer. Since I'm using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), it's being pretty straightforward because I already had experience with using Markdown - for instance, in my Master's Thesis.

I haven't decided yet what to use this blog for, but at least now I have a site where I can share my ideas!

See you around!
